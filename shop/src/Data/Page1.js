        In our latest blog post we will explore the creative approaches that some of the world’s cities are using to build resilient and pleasant environments for people (and perhaps horses) to live.

        <p>
        Winter presents unique challenges for cities around the world. From the northern reaches of Scandinavia to the bustling metropolises of North America and Asia, urban centers must cope with everything from snow removal and transportation disruptions to ensuring the well-being of their residents during extreme cold.

        <h3>Clearing the snow</h3>
        <p>
        One of the most immediate challenges winter brings is the need to keep the roads and pathways clear of snow. Sweden keeps their snow clearing efforts as environmentally friendly as possible by using a fleet of snow plows and snow cannons that use a mixture of snow and water, reducing the need for harmful de-icing chemicals. This not only protects the environment but also safeguards the city’s water sources
        Many cities around the world use salt to help keep the road safe and free of snow and ice. Although effective, this approach has a number of environmental drawbacks, especially when the residual salt enters farmland. A number of alternatives have been proposed, including the use of beet juice, mixed with sugar and salt, as well as a biomass salt made from grass and organic waste.

        <h3>Innovative Heating Solutions</h3>
        <p>Extreme cold poses significant risks to public health, making heating solutions a top priority for many cities. Reykjavik faces particularly harsh winter conditions. To combat this, the city taps into its unique geothermal resources, utilizing natural hot springs to heat public spaces and even pedestrian walkways. This creative approach not only keeps residents warm but also underscores the city’s commitment to sustainability.</p>
        <p>The city of Harbin in northeastern China has embraced its chilly climate by hosting an annual Ice Festival. During the festival, intricate ice sculptures illuminate the city, turning the harsh winter into a tourist attraction. By doing this, Harbin has turned its cold weather into an economic opportunity, showcasing how creativity can transform a potential challenge into a unique asset.</p>
