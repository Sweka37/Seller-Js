        This may seem a rather bizarre question. The ability for the weather to change our moods is well known. Some individuals prefer warm and sunny weather, and there are those individuals known as pluviophiles, who can find comfort, peace and joy during rainy days.Weather watchers around the world can find the sheer variability of our weather patterns fascinating.

        <h3 className='title'>Smiling Rainbows</h3>
        <p>
        One weather mood is known as the Circumzenithal arc. This looks like an upside-down rainbow - a multi-colored smiling face, hovering above the ground, with its spectrum of colors pointing upwards. Although these smiling rainbows are actually quite common, they are not always seen as they are often obscured from the ground by clouds. 
<br></br>
Even though these wonderful phenomena seem to be similar to rainbows, they are actually formed in different ways. The traditional rainbow is formed by light bending and being separated as it passes through rain droplets. The Circumzenithal arc is created as light is refracted through hexagonal ice crystals, held in cirrus clouds, in a very specific way.

        <p> Some were once considered figments of imagination, and given fairy-tale names such as red sprites, blue jets, elves, trolls and gnomes. These are bright flashes of light that happen high above thunderstorm clouds. Sightings were first documented, and dismissed as fables as far back as 1886. 
          <br></br>Unlike lightning, that travels from the clouds down to earth, these enigmatic entities flow upwards. Scientifically known as Transient Luminous Events or TLEs,  the light is caused by large scale electrical discharges from cumulonimbus clouds upwards, to the electrically charged ionosphere. They are often triggered by positively charged lightning flowing from the underlying thunder cloud and the ground. 
          They can sour up to 60 miles high, and last for just a fraction of a second.

          n contrast, Blue Jets can only be seen from an aircraft, they are a dim blue color, and appear to be similar to smoke, rising up from a hailstorm.

Elves - or “Emissions of Light and Very low frequency from EMP Sources”, are dim discs of light that appear about 60 miles high in our atmosphere. 
<br></br>
Trolls - “Transient Red Optical Luminous Lineament” are the red spots of light that follow a red sprite, and can be seen just above the tops of the clouds.
<br></br>
Gnomes - Are the smallest and quickest of all TLEs, and are small, white flashes of light that appear above the anvil of a thunderstorm. </p>
